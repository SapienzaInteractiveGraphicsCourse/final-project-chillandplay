## How to play
Select the minigame you want to play.

Choose the frog if you want to play as a fly, bother the frog while trying to not get eaten.
Move the mouse to pull the fly around the screen, and don't sit still for too long.
The closer you get to the frog, the more dangerous it becomes!

Choose the sheep if you want to feel like a farmer. Grab the scissors and move them over the sheep to remove the wool tufts.
Click and drag, or use the arrow keys, to rotate the sheep so you don't miss any spot.
